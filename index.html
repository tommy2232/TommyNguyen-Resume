        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello. I am a 2nd year Prebusiness Major looking to concentrate in Information Systems here. My education is currently at University of California, Riverside. From Garden Grove, Orange County, I am an Eagle Scout who loves outdoor activities and staying active. Growing up, I enjoy playing volleyball and cooking steak. I have many other hobbies including being a barber and working out. The most important things in my life are the people I am surrounded by Family plays a large role in my life. I have two siblings that play a large role in my life. My older brother Thomas teaches me to be strong for myself and others. I always look up to him in times of need because he has been through many of the things I have and his perspective is key to my success. In addition, my younger sister Tina teaches me love and compassion for those around me. I feel that I have to become a good older brother to her because that is what was given to me. I feel that I owe it to her as a person. From my mom, I have learned to always see the best in others. This has given me many opportunities that I never could have imagined if I here otherwise. From my dad, he teaches me wisdom and good decision making skills. This has taught me to invest in my long term success instead of short term satisfaction. I am a strong people person through these traits that I have acquired through them. On my free time, I enjoy playing volleyball with my close friends, cooking food (such as steak, fried rice, and french toast), and cutting hair. I have been a barber for half a year now and I am developing this skill in my free time in college. This is to help polish my time management skills, accountability, and business operating skills. This small business of mine has been something I am passionate about, and I seek to use these real-world skills in the future. I am looking for an opportunity to benefit others with my skills while learning as much as I can from that experience. These opportunities will allow me to widen my expertise in any region and I am grateful to have the ability to learn and become a better person. It is important to me that I am always becoming a better person. I am constantly working on myself at the gym to become a physically healthy member of society. From there, I work on my mental strength. Areas of discipline, confidence, and grit are of utmost importance to me because with those traits, I can drive myself to overcome any obstacle. In my life, education is important. I am using whatever I have learned in my life in order to achieve maximal success output. This is how I will achieve it. In this resume, I will show you how I can be of help to your organization. I hope you take consideration in my application and give me a chance because I will make sure you will be happy with that decision. Together, we can work towards a greater future of success.
